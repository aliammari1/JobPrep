This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## 📱 PWA Support

This application is configured as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** with full offline support!

### Features

- ✅ **Install on any device** (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- ✅ **Works offline** - access cached content without internet
- ✅ **Fast loading** - service worker caches assets
- ✅ **Network-first strategy** - always tries to fetch fresh content
- ✅ **Auto-sync** - changes sync when back online

### Quick PWA Setup

The PWA is already configured! Just run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm run build && npm start
```

For detailed PWA documentation, see [docs/PWA_SETUP.md](docs/PWA_SETUP.md)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
